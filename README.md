# rsnapshot (slave) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/osiell/ansible-rsnapshot-slave.png)](https://travis-ci.org/osiell/ansible-rsnapshot-slave)

Ansible role to install rsync and configure the system to be backed up by
the `rsnapshot-master` role.
For this purpose, this role creates a system user with sudo privileges on
the `rsync` program. The public SSH key is retrieved from the master host
(defined by the `rsnapshot-master` role) and added to the user's authorized
keys.

Minimum Ansible Version: 1.5
